     1.  Arithmetic Operators

      Operator         Name             Example
         +           Addition             X+Y
         _          Subtraction           X-Y
         *         Multiplication         X*Y
         /          Division              X/Y
         %          Modulus               X%Y
        **          Exponents             X**Y
        //          Floor Division        X//Y
